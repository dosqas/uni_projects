### 3. Movie Rental
Write an application for movie rentals. The application will store:
- **Movie**: `movie_id`, `title`, `description`, `genre`
- **Client**: `client_id`, `name`
- **Rental**: `rental_id`, `movie_id`, `client_id`, `rented_date`, `due_date`, `returned_date`

Create an application which allows to:
1. Manage clients and movies. The user can add, remove, update, and list both clients and movies.
2. Rent or return a movie. A client can rent a movie until a given date, as long as they have no rented movies that passed their due date for return. A client can return a rented movie at any time.
3. Search for clients or movies using any one of their fields (e.g. movies can be searched for using id, title, description or genre). The search must work using case-insensitive, partial string matching, and must return all matching items.
4. Create statistics:
    - Most rented movies. This will provide the list of movies, sorted in descending order of the number of days they were rented.
    - Most active clients. This will provide the list of clients, sorted in descending order of the number of movie rental days they have (e.g. having 2 rented movies for 3 days each counts as 2 x 3 = 6 days).
    - Late rentals. All the movies that are currently rented, for which the due date for return has passed, sorted in descending order of the number of days of delay.
